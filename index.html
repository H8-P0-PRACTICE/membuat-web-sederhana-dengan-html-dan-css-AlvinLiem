                The users of Zoan-type Devil Fruits gain the ability to transform into a specific animal, as well as
                transform into a hybrid form that combines attributes of their own species and the species the fruit
                allows them to transform into. Unlike other Devil Fruits, Zoan-type fruits are said to have a will of
                their own. A recently discovered science allows Zoan Fruits to be integrated into inanimate objects,
                bringing the object to life and granting it the standard Zoan transformations.

                The most common of the three Devil Fruit types, Paramecia-type Devil Fruits grant their users any one of
                a wide variety of superhuman powers; these powers include things like shock wave generation and locking
                onto targets. Paramecia Fruits can alter features of the user's body, granting them a slippery physique,
                a body of blades, or the ability to split their own body into pieces harmlessly. Some Paramecia Fruits
                allow the user to modify the people, objects, and environment around them by making things levitate or
                turning people into toys. Finally, some fruits exist that allow users to generate and manipulate
                substances, like wax or poison.
